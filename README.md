# Project-4 | Machine Learning in Healthcare – Predicting Diabetes and Heart Disease Risks 
Group 1 Members: Maha Pentakota, Sapir Madar Coulson, Michael Villeda, Ana Garcia, Daniel Grimm 

Project Overview 

Our goal for this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the risks of diabetes 
and heart disease based on patient health data pulled from several different datasets from 
publicly-available health sources. Since the contributing factors and symptoms of diabetes 
and heart disease are deeply related and correlated, our model will analyze key health indicators 
to assess a patient’s likelihood of developing these diseases.   
We will use several machine learning techniques to identify high-risk diets, life 
factors, and individual characteristics to reveal patterns that could aid in early detection and 
prevention.
